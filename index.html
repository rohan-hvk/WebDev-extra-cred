            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>This website was created as part of a group project for extra credit in my Management Information Systems course. However, I decided to take on this project solo to improve my skills and boost my grade. The site highlights my professional profile, my projects, and a detailed reflection on the importance of Business Intelligence (BI) in decision-making.</p>
            <p>I have included an interactive quiz related to BI concepts and showcased some of my programming skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website reflects my technical knowledge and dedication to self-improvement.</p>
